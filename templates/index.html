                            <p>During my time at Trade Me, I grew a relatively ambiguous/disengaged team to being one with the highest engagement scores, as reported by <a href="http://www-07.ibm.com/nz/bestworkplaces/" target="_blank">Kenexa</a>, within Customer Services.</p>
                            <p>I worked hard to form solid relationships with each of my team members that allowed them the freedom and flexibility to grow, but also the support they required throughout their time at Trade Me.</p>
                            <p>Informal, weekly catch-ups with everyone allowed me to keep the finger on the pulse with how everyone was feeling but also gave me the opportunity to highlight any great work or progressions they made and to address any concerns or issues early on before they became problems that would affect their work.</p>
                            <p>In addition to my Kenexa scores being the highest in Customer Services, my monthly Team Temperature Check scores were consistently the highest across the Team Leader group; showing that the work I was doing with my team was both enjoyable by them and effective in promoting their development.</p>

                            <p>Academically, I’ve always done pretty well and when it came to business and economics at high school I always had strong results.</p>
                            <p>Naturally I took this through to University, originally planning to major in e-Commerce and Finance. It took one trimester of Information Systems to change my mind and I promptly dropped Finance and picked up Information Systems; which it turns out was a good choice as this and e-Commerce go hand-in-hand.</p>
                            <p>My father always said when you enjoy something, you’ll usually be pretty good at it – in this case I really loved my studies, found the topics really easy to understand and explore, and walked away with an A- average which I was really proud to show.</p>
                            <p>If you’re interested to see what I covered:</p>

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Systems Lead, Technical Consultant, and Founding Developer.</p>
                            <p>FiveRP is a heavy roleplay server for our own custom-built mod client, built by an experienced team of roleplay veterans.</p>
                            <p>Whilst not coming from a roleplaying background, I did possess the technical skills to help get this off the ground and was drafted in to the project by a colleague and friend of mine.</p>
                            <p>Initially I was going to take care of all the systems that supported the server and gamemode, running and servicing the databases, servers, and providing input and installation to any further programs or packages we took on board.</p>
                            <p>This naturally escalated to me providing technical insight to nearly every part of the project, having a good natured relationship with the core founder and the other founding staff made this really easy and allowed ideas and suggestions to be tossed around in an open, but critical, environment.</p>
                            <p>Having provided such a level of insight and setup in to the systems that underpin this gamemode, I decided to try my hand at developing some of the applications involved. This turned in to a full-time endeavour and I quickly became one of the founding developers of FiveRP and the sole developer of the '<a href="https://ucp.fiverp.net" target="_blank">UCP</a>' which is a control panel critical to the gamemode of FiveRP.</p>

                            <h2>Hourglass Web Design</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Personal Web Development Compnany</p>
                            <p>During my tertiary education my courses required me to get involved with some basic Web Development. This was mainly based around using ASP.NET and C# and opened my eyes to a much more powerful way to build websites than just with plain, vanilla HTML.</p>
                            <p>In my second year, one of the courses was to work on an IT project for someone in the community. After pairing up with a classmate, we found a lady who was running a Lavender Boutique store out of the corner of another store and who was running an online store through an extortionate online service.</p>
                            <p>We offered to help her out with all of this, to set her up with a website that she had sole control over that offered her the ability to sell her hand-crafted Lavender products that she could easily use with minimal IT knowledge. Needless to say, this revolutionised how she was running her business and 3 years on she is still going strong with the web application we built for her.</p>
                            <p>I found I had a real passion for this type of work, and often found my spare-time being soaked up on small IT projects. A couple of friends were studying marketing and digital design at the time, and we had a mad idea one night to go about trying our hand at providing our skills as a service; as a way of putting our tertiary study to practical use; out of the woodwork came Hourglass Web Design.</p>
                            <p>We ran this business for a couple of years as a part-time venture in and around our study and actual jobs. This resulted in us providing work for 6 clients, before disbanding as we went our separate ways post-study.</p>
                            <p>A lot of learnings came from this, the biggest, though, would be:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The need for tight planning and clear communication with clients to ensure the end result is exactly what they envisioned</li>
                                <li>Ensuring we used the right tool for the job; there are a tonne of vendors these days offering powerful applications that already have the work done for you – not everyone needed a custom-built web application</li>
                                <li>The need to really market your strengths in a market saturated with many other digital agencies doing exactly the same thing – you need to find an offering that really stands-out to the consumers you’re trying to target</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Whilst short-lived, it was a valuable experience, and it didn’t go to waste at all – the skills I gained still go to use today, in all the personal projects I do and run.</p>

                            <h2>Coaching &amp; Mentoring</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Coaching various groups and individuals in both academics and sports.</p>
                            <p>I tend to have a knack for picking things up pretty easily, it’s probably one of the biggest contributing factors to my success in life so far. I can delve in to a subject, pick up a new task or skill, or go to play a new sport, and naturally I’ll master this pretty quick – however there are many people who aren’t that lucky and people who have helped coach me in situations when this hasn’t been the case.</p>
                            <p>Giving back to people is something that is rewarding in its own right, seeing people improve, progress, and come out better off thanks to input from you will always be something that puts a smile on my face.</p>
                            <p>During my schooling years, I was an avid Canoe Polo player, with my team and I reaching number 1 in New Zealand at the Secondary School level in 2011. We were a real driving force behind it becoming a popular sport at our school and part of this involved coaching teams of all ages and skill levels, which I did for all 5 years of my secondary schooling.</p>
                            <p>After leaving school and heading off to University, I found that when you really enjoy something you’re usually pretty good at it – which was a reality when it came to e-Commerce and Information System related courses. I was invited to tutor these topics by the University, and mentored a handful of students in specific areas to a level where they were all passing their papers with a B+ average. </p>
                            <p>Extending from my academic mentoring, I helped tutor a couple of undergraduate candidates in specific areas to help them achieve University Entrance – without which they could not have received tertiary study.</p>
                            <p>From a career perspective, my first two jobs involved only basic teaching; how to do the tasks necessary for the job and how to use any systems that supported this. However, at Ticketek I was responsible for helping train people at various levels of their roles and teaching them skills to help improve in their current level. As lead supervisor on event days, I would also be responsible for bringing temp staff up to a level where they could comfortably use our systems within 30 odd minutes – a process that usually takes permanent staff some time to master.</p>
                            <p>The biggest area that I’m proud of in this space though is my work at Trade Me as a Team Leader. I’ve read countless articles that talk about how great leaders double as great coaches and I can certainly attest to this. I put an active effort in to developing all of my staff in areas where it is needed and then supporting their development when they no longer need active support. I employ a range of techniques to achieve this and the success that I’ve seen from this shows in their results and in my Kenexa scores which showed me to achieve the highest scores out of any Team Leader in Customer Support.</p>

                            <p>This involves the use of two different Business Intelligence platforms that we have developed in-house, and through the use of raw SQL queries from our various databases.</p>
                            <p>Part of this involves managing relationships with the Product Owners of the BI platforms to ensure that information that they provide is up-to-date and relevant to our business area, as well as providing input in to enhancements that could be made to ensure the continued and valuable insight that these tools provide.</p>
